## Personal Profile

I am a senior software architect with broad experience of every aspect of
large-scale web-based application strategy, planning, development, and
maintenance. I have defined and delivered high-level strategic and technical
roadmaps for programmes of work, leading teams to deliver effective solutions.

I have worked in a product owner role, and have an excellent understanding of
the interplay between technical and product to produce solutions in line with,
or exceeding users' needs, and am comfortable communicating and translating
between technical and non-technical audiences.

## Work History

#### Lead Technical Architect at GDS (2016–present)

After joining GDS as a Technical Architect in 2016, I quickly moved in to the
position of Lead Technical Architect for the GOV.UK programme on an interim
basis, to lead the technical work of maintaining the high quality bar of GOV.UK
as the UK governments flagship, award-winning website. My role has included:

* Leading a team of four senior technologists (Technical Architects and Lead
  Developers) to guide and support the forty technologists working on the
  GOV.UK programme to ensure the continued delivery of the development work
  required to support and improve.

* Setting architectural goals, and defining the technical and platform strategy
  to allow GOV.UK to continue to meet the changing demands of both government
  and citizens.

* Maintaining and improving the security of GOV.UK by increasing awareness of
  security concerns and risks, including setting up a regular schedule of
  application and infrastructure penetration tests, and by working with other
  departments to trial a form of intelligence-led testing new to government.

* Managing technical and information risks, including lead roles in GDPR
  readiness preparations, and ongoing information assurance issues.

* Responsibility for managing and reducing the large levels of technical debt
  that had accumulated within GOV.UK during the initial build phase.

* Working with lead delivery and product managers to identify the technical
  requirements of the product and delivery roadmaps, while maintaining a strong
  focus on the user needs of the platform. Defining project mission scopes,
  objectives, and team makeups, and supporting those teams throughout the
  delivery process.

* Supporting the Technical Architecture community within GDS at a time when
  there was no Head of Community in position, ensuring that communication
  across GDS remained efficient, that programmes were effectively resourced,
  and that recruitment of new architects continued.

* Defining consistent cross-organisation patterns, tools, and processes for use
  by GDS teams when building and operating services. Responsible for ensuring
  GOV.UK adoption of these standardised practices.

* Taking ownership of undersupported parts of GOV.UK such as Licensing, setting
  up a maintenance programme, while leading the architecture work of the
  Discovery and Alpha phases of a potential replacement. This led to a need to
  convince senior GDS management that Licensing wasn't a service that GOV.UK
  (or GDS) should continue to provide. Transition of the functions of the
  service to other central and local government departments is in progress.

* Engaging with cross-government leaders on technical decisions which affect
  departments and users outside of GOV.UK's direct remit, such as working
  towards the retirement of TLS 1.0/1.1, and on setting cross-government
  standards, such as the API technical and data standards.


#### Venntro _(was Global Personals)_ (2008–2016)

Throughout my time at Venntro, I moved through three different roles: lead
developer, technical product owner, and technical architect. Throughout all
roles, I lead the development of the White Label Dating platform, including
setting technical direction, supporting developers, and ensuring the
availability and security of the platform.  I also worked at a senior
management level throughout my time at Venntro, constantly liaising with other
departments and senior managers in terms of planning company strategy and
direction.

* **WhiteLabelDating**: Lead the design and build of the WhiteLabelDating (WLD)
  platform from the ground up: a multi-tenant online dating application which
  supported 25,000 sites, a new member signing up every 3.5 seconds, with
  revenues in excess of £50m/year, and with a 180-person company grown
  alongside to support it.

* **WLD mobile web application**: Architected, project managed and — working
  with a team of 15 — built a new mobile web application and service layer for
  WLD.  Created a SOA-based architecture, build on top of a REST API exposing
  business logic from the core ColdFusion WLD application.  The stack consisted
  of 4 Ruby-based services, communicating via HTTP and JSON, with a Node.js
  router and authentication service, and a Rails front-end application.

* **RabbitMQ-based email pipeline**: Architected and worked with a small team
  to build a Ruby and RabbitMQ-based pipeline for rendering and sending emails
  for the WLD platform.  At peak, this was sending in excess of 20M emails per
  day.

* **Event platform**: Introduced a RabbitMQ-based events stream to the WLD
  platform which is currently being used for a range of diverse applications
  such as instant application notifications via Pusher, flushing changed assets
  from a CDN (Akamai), analysing member behaviour to identify scammers, and
  scheduling messages to send to users.

* **Payment gateway switch**: Given 8 weeks to switch processing of
  approximately 10,000 daily transactions to another payment gateway,
  architected and managed the work which was completed in 6 weeks with zero
  impact on end users and application uptime.

* **PCI-compliant payment processing**: Designed and helped build a new payment
  system for processing all new card transactions that could be sandboxed for
  PCI DSS 3 compliance.  Played a key role in the preparation for the
  compliance assessment, including drafting and publishing our team development
  standards for code, code review, and application security, and through
  liaising with external penetration testers.

* **Agile transformation**: Part of a small team that spearheaded the agile
  transformation of the 45-person development team, moving from traditional
  waterfall to a Scrum process, with 4 cross-functional teams of between 6-10
  working in sprints of two weeks.  After the change, I took on a Product Owner
  (PO) role for around 15 months, working with the CTO and one other PO to
  liaise with the rest of the business and manage the backlog of work for the
  Scrum teams.

#### Lead Developer at Rawnet (2002–2008)

Rawnet is a web agency based in Berkshire.  I joined as the first employee and
lead developer, and worked building custom websites and application for clients
such as SciDev, Williams F1, Guards Polo Club and Go Ape.

* Lead development in a large number and range of client projects, from small
  websites through to large, custom business-process applications.
* Led application development and server infrastructure throughout the company,
  including development practices and processes.
* Managed a team of 5 developers from junior through to senior levels.
* Attended and fully contributed to client meetings, and regularly saw projects
  from initial pitch through to final delivery, as well as providing ongoing
  support and customer client management.

## Education

* **1997-2002**: MEng (Hons) Software Engineering, Aberystwyth University
* **1995-1997**: A-levels in maths, physics and economics
