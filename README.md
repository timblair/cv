I am a senior technical leader and technical architect with broad experience of
large-scale web-based application strategy, planning, development, and
maintenance. I have defined and delivered high-level strategic and technical
roadmaps for programmes of work, building and leading teams and broader
communities to deliver effective solutions.

I have an excellent understanding of the interplay between technology,
delivery, and product to produce solutions in line with, or exceeding users'
needs, and am comfortable communicating and translating between technical and
non-technical audiences and senior stakeholders.

## Lead Technical Architect, Cabinet Office CDIO (2021–present)

In 2021 I moved to the Digital Delivery pillar in the recently-formed Cabinet

* Developing the technical operational model to enable the Digital Delivery
  pillar to become an effective digital delivery partner for Cabinet Office
  business units.

  work to be delivered by Digital Delivery, running recruitment to fill all

  creating forums where both Civil Servant and contractors can learn from each
  other, and creating L&D opportunities (for example, driving TOGAF training
  for technical architects).

  AWS and GitHub services owned by CDIO and offered to the wider Cabinet
  Office.

* Determining the technical approaches and standards to be used within both

In 2019 I formally took on the role of Head of Technology for the GOV.UK
