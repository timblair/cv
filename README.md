## Personal Profile

I am a generalist developer and web architect with experience of every aspect
of large-scale web-based application development and planning, from initial
concept, application architecture and development, through to the operational
concerns of datastores and hosting platforms.  Also a strong team leader and
manager, focussing on marrying development best-practices with the business
goals of the project in hand.  I also have experience working at senior
management level, including elements of strategic planning.  

I have a passion for ensuring that developers are working as effectively and
efficiently as possible, as well as constantly learning.  I have organised and
run hack days and tech talks, and this interest also extends to teaching
outside the work environment: I have recently become an accredited trainer for
CodeClubPro, which exists to assist primary school teachers in learning the new
Computing Curriculum to be taught in schools from September 2014.

I am a keen sportsman: in 2013 I took part in a 2-day race across Scotland on
foot and by bike to raise money for Epilepsy Research UK, and have competed at
the highest level at the sport of Ultimate Frisbee, by representing Great
Britain at both European and world-level competition.

* HTTP and HTTP-based APIs, JSON, XML, SOA
* Apache, nginx, Passenger, Heroku
* Software architecture
* Team leadership, team development and communication

## Project Examples

* **WhiteLabelDating**: Designed, built and supported the WhiteLabelDating
  (WLD) platform from the ground up: a multi-tenant online dating application
  which now supports 14,500 sites with revenues in excess of £50m/year, and
  with a 180-person company grown alongside to support it.  The core platform
  is based on ColdFusion, with a series of supporting Ruby applications and
  background processes.

* **WLD mobile web application**: Designed, project managed and — working with
  a team of 15 — created a new mobile web application and service layer for
  WLD.  Created a SOA-based architecture, build on top of a REST API exposing
  business logic from the core ColdFusion WLD application.  The stack consisted
  of 4 Ruby-based services, communicating via HTTP and JSON, with a Node.js
  router and authentication service, and a Rails front-end application.

* **RabbitMQ-based email pipeline**: Architected and worked with a small team
  to build a Ruby and RabbitMQ-based pipeline for rendering and sending emails
  for the WLD platform.  At peak, this was sending in excess of 20m emails per
  day.

* **Event platform**: Introduced a RabbitMQ-based events stream to the WLD
  platform which is currently being used for a range of diverse applications
  such as instant application notifications via Pusher, flushing changed assets
  from a CDN (Akamai), analysing member behaviour to identify scammers, and
  scheduling messages to send to users.

* **Payment gateway switch**: Given 8 weeks to switch processing of
  approximately 10,000 daily transactions to another payment gateway,
  architected and project managed the work which was completed in 6 weeks with
  zero impact on end users and application uptime.

* **PCI-compliant payment processing**: Designed and helped build a new payment
  application for processing all new card transactions that could be sandboxed
  for PCI DSS 3 compliance. Also played a key role in the preparation for the
  compliance assessment, including drafting and publishing our team development
  standards for code, code review and application security, and through
  liaising with external penetration testers.

## Work History

#### Global Personals (2008–present)

Over the last decade — incorporating roles at both Global Personals (GP) and
Rawnet — I have built and scaled a multitenant white-label online dating
platform that currently supports 14,500 sites across 4 continents, with
revenues of £50m/year, and a new user signing up every 3.5 seconds.

The core business of GP is the WLD platform.  I wrote the first lines of code
for the platform, and have been overseeing the platform's growth ever since.
My role at GP has changed over the years, but I've always led the platform
architecture, and play a lead role in the management of the development
department (currently 45 people).

In addition to development-related activities, I have worked at a senior
management level throughout my time at GP, constantly liaising with other
departments and senior managers in terms of planning company strategy and
direction.

###### Platform Architect (2012–present)

* Longer-term planning for the WLD platform, including involvement at Board
  level in defining and agreeing the changes required and the business
  implications.
* Also heavily involved in the day-to-day development of the platform, both
  from a code perspective, and giving guidance in terms of direction.

###### Technical Product Owner (2013—2015)

* After the change to an agile development process, I took on a Product Owner
  (PO) role, working with the CTO and one other PO to liaise with the rest of
  the business and manage the backlog of work for the Scrum teams.
* Part of a small team that spearheaded the agile transformation of the
  45-person development team, moving from traditional waterfall to a Scrum
  process, with 4 cross-functional teams of between 6-10 working in sprints of
  two weeks.

###### Head of Engineering (2010-2012)

* Direct line management responsibilies for a team of 5 Ruby engineers,
  focussing on the back-end systems of the WLD platform.
* Work focussed primarily around background tasks (utilising RabbitMQ and
  Redis) and creating an SOA service layer on which the WLD mobile application
  was built.

###### Lead Developer (2008-2010)

* Day-to-day development work in both ColdFusion and Ruby, enhancing and
  supporting the WLD platform.
* Created a REST API on top of the existing ColdFusion business platform,
  including creating an [open-sourced
  framework](https://github.com/timblair/restfulcf).
* Led the team who built a completely new user interface layer, including both
  back-end and front-end development, and migrated several thousand sites from
  the old interface.

#### Rawnet (2002–2008)

Rawnet is a web agency based in Berkshire.  I joined as the first employee and
worked building custom web sites and application for clients such as SciDev,
Williams F1, Guards Polo Club and Go Ape.  The initial implementation of
WhiteLabelDating was also developed during my time at Rawnet.

###### Technical Director (2007-2008)

* Managed a team of 5 developers from junior through to senior levels.
* Oversaw application development and server infrastructure throughout the
  company, including development practices and processes.

###### Lead Developer (2002-2007)

* Lead contributor to a large number and range of client projects, from small
  websites through to large, custom business-process applications.
* Attended and fully contributed to client meetings, and regularly saw projects
  from initial pitch through to final delivery, as well as providing ongoing
  support and customer client management.
* Developed two versions of a presentation management software system (the
  first using Flex, the second using Ajax-based techniques: cutting-edge at the
  time) which was used by large and international companies such as Centrica,
  Honda, Canon and the Lawn Tennis Association.

## Community

* **BarCamp London**: Part of the team that planned and ran BarCamp London 8
  and 9, which were weekend-long unconferences for over 300 people.

* **Tech Talks**: Initiated and ran a series of monthly brown-bag style tech
  talks at Global Personals for the past 2.5 years, including personally giving
  talks, such as [Git 102](http://teajay.be/git-102).

* **Hack Days**: Planned and ran two internal hack days at Global Personals,
  leading to a number of new and innovative features being added to the WLD
  platform.  Also created [blog posts](http://teajay.be/how-to-run-a-hack-day)
  and [proposal
  documents](http://www.scribd.com/doc/89031105/Hack-Day-Proposal) to help
  others run their own hack days.

## Education

* **1997-2002**: MEng (Hons) Software Engineering, Aberystwyth University
* **1995-1997**: A-levels in maths, physics and economics
